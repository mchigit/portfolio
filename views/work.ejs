                    <p>At Sortable, I was responsible for implementing new features and decreasing technical debt for Sortable
                        Analytics platform. Such tasks included increase Hive querying performance, assisting with reducing AWS costs etc. 
                        <br /> During my time at Sortable, I have created a complex system to allow the platform to automatically generate, format reports,
                        and send them to clients based on scheduling configurations.

                        My main responsibility was to maintain and upgrade internal APIs using Node, and an internal management web tool using React. <br />
                        Two projects I completed at IBM included the SSO feature for the ICM (IBM Incentive Compensation Management) web application, 
                        and an IP Address Whitelist System to provide better security.

                    <p>
                        During my time at Scotiabank, I worked on a reporting web application from scratch using ASP.NET, 
                        and also optmized the application's querying and rendering performance by more than 50%. <br />
                        Some other tasks included creating an application to extract Excel data to SQL Server, 
                        redesigning user interfaces of web apps to enhance user experience, as well as documenting application structures for future development.

                        I maintained and upgraded a desktop application for the QA team at TTC using VBA and Access, 
                        and I was responsible for contacting the user directly for requirements and the release of new updates to the software. <br />
                        I also designed and developed multiple web applications using ASP.NET,
                         as well as optimized application performance by creating stored procedures and triggers in SQL Server.
